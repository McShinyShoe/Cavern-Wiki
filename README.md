### World
Our server have three types of worls, which is:
- **Main World**, There is only one instance of this type of world which is the mainworld and its only have overworld dimension, this is where you want to build bases because the world itself wont reset and most slimefun stuff are enabled in this world.
- **Resource World**, In this type of world, the world will reset every month regularly. Usually the reset will be anounced in our discord server and there will be a serverwide event killing the ender dragon. There is 3 types of resource which is Overworld resource, Nether resource, and End resource.
- **Server World**, This type of world are managed by the server and cant be modified by the player.

### Basic Commands
There are many ways to 
1. **Navigation Commands**
  
To navigate the server easily, we profide serveral commands that aids you to navigate throughout the server worlds and location.

  - Home Commands
  
    In this server you can set up ur a private teleportation where only you can teleport to called homes. Each player can set a finite amount of homes and that player rank determines the amount of homes they can set.

    |Command|Uses|
    |-|-|
    |`/sethome <homename>`|Set a home in player standing position|
    |`/home <homename>`|Teleports to a home|
    |`/delhome <homename>`|Deletes a home|
    |`/homes`|List all of the homes you have|
    
    A player can set up a home using the command `/sethome <homename>`. After a player set a home they can teleport to that home location by typing `/home <homename>`. When a player want to change the home location, they can do the same command as setting up the home with the same homename `/sethome <homename>`. And if the player wish to remove their home they can remove it using `/delhome homename`. `/homes` can be used if you want to get the list of homes that you have set.

    Teleporting to a home requires the player to stand still for 3 seconds before they were teleported. When a home is obfuscated, it will teleport you to the nearest safe area to teleport

    When creating a home, the server checks if you are on a save area or not. A location considered "Safe" when you stand on it, it doesnt dammage the player, the block in the player head is a hollow block, and it is inside the world border<sup><a href="https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/71ca7ffbf6c36c9fd18cf61056295dca4a733f62/Essentials/src/main/java/com/earth2me/essentials/utils/LocationUtil.java#L146">[1]</a></sup>. A location is considered dammaging if the block below is a block that can dammage a player<sup><a href="https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/71ca7ffbf6c36c9fd18cf61056295dca4a733f62/Essentials/src/main/java/com/earth2me/essentials/utils/LocationUtil.java#L164">[2]</a></sup>.

    |-|-|
    |`/pw help`|Displaya help menu|

    |`/pw set <warp>`|Sets a warp in player locaotion|
    |`/pw remove <warp>`|Remove a player warp|
    |`/pw desc set <warp> <desc>`|Set a player warp description|

    |`/pw list`|List all player warp|
    |`/pw ban set <warp> <player>`|Bans a player from player warp|
    |`/pw ban remove <warp> <player>`|Unbans a player from player warp|

    |`/pw password set <warp>`|Set a player warp password|
    |`/pw password remove <warp> <password>`| Remove a player warp password|

    The amount of player warp you can have per player depends on your rank. The amount of player warp per rank can be seen in the [ranks](#ranks) section.

    When you want to move a player warp or wants to discontinue it, it is highly suggested that u do not remove the player warp, but re-set it instead or lock it. When you remove a player warp, every info about it like total visits and reviews will be reset, which mean you will lost all of that when u remove it.

    When opening the player warp gui menu(without specifying a category), you will be asked to choose a category to open, click one of the category to see the list of player warp in that category. A player warp can be categorized into 5 category, which is `build`, `farm`, `other`, `pvp`, and `shop`.

### Server Ranks
In this server there is two types of rank that you can get, in-game ranks and store rank. In-game ranks can be obtained by buying them in `/ranks`, or u can also rankup into your next rank using `/rankup`. 

|Rank|Upgrade Price|Total Price|
|-|-|-|
|Citizen|10,000|10,000|
|Merchant|45,000|55,000|
|Clerk|65,000|120,000|
|Novice|90,000|210,000|
|Apprentice|110,000|320,000|
|Squire|140,000|460,000|
   
The second type of ranks is the store ranks. Store ranks is a bit diffrent from in-game ranks because it actually cant be bought using in-game currency(althought you can pay another person to donate for you, see the [IRL Trading](#irl-trading) section). The things that also makes store ranks different from in-game ranks is that store ranks will overwrite the ingame rank, meaning you dont have to be a certain rain to obtain a stora ranks. When you bought a store rank, your in-game rank will be the same but the store rank will overwrite every perks your in-game rank have. This means if you for example transfer your donator rank in your bedrock into your java account, your bedrock account will be back using your ingame rank. You can also rankup ur ingame rank using `/ranks` and `/rankup` even tho u already have a store rank.

|Store|Upgrade Price|Total Price|
|-|-|-|
|Viscount|10.00 USD|10.00 USD|
|Duke|15.00 USD|25.00 USD|
|King|25.00 USD|50.00 USD|

Each of the store rank have also a female-equivalent title in each store rank. you can use the command `/<ranktitle>` to change ur rank title into the desired title. Here are the list of title and their counterpart.

|Male|Female|
|-|-|
|viscount|viscountes|
|duke|duchess|
|king|queen|

Each rank can give you many perks. Here are some of those perks that you can get for each rank:

|Perk|Newcomer|Citizen|Merchant|Clerk|Novice|Apprentice|Squire|Viscount|Duke|King|
